## Usage

### Trigger Keywords
- `screentime` - Show full screen time statistics
- `st` - Short alias for screen time

### Commands
- `screentime` or `st` - Display compact Digital Wellbeing summary
- `st list` - Show detailed app usage grid
- `st apps` - Same as list (alternative command)
- `st week` - Display weekly statistics and trends
- `st <app_name>` - Search for specific application with weekly comparison

### Examples
```
screentime          # Compact summary (header + cards only)
st                  # Short alias for compact view
st list             # Full app usage grid
st apps             # Alternative for app list
st week             # Weekly statistics
st firefox          # Firefox usage details
st code             # VS Code usage details
```

## Interface Components

### üè† Main Dashboard (Default View)
- **Large Time Display**: Prominent display of total screen time today
- **Summary Cards**:
  - Most Used App with time spent
  - Total Apps Used count
  - Average Session Length per app
- **Compact Layout**: Clean summary without app grid (540x150px)

### üì± App List View (`st list`)
- **Full App Grid**: Top 12 applications displayed in a 3-column grid layout
- **Detailed View**: Shows individual app icons, names, and usage times
- **Expanded Layout**: Larger widget (540x250px) to accommodate grid

### üìä Statistics Display
- **Real Application Icons**: Displays actual application icons from system theme
- **Usage Comparison**: Compare today vs yesterday with difference indicators
- **Weekly Averages**: Show daily averages for each application
- **Compact Grid Layout**:
  - 32px application icons optimized for launcher
  - 3-column grid layout (80x70px cards)
  - App name and usage time display (no percentages)
  - Automatic fallback to default application icon
  - Icon caching for improved performance
- **Launcher-Optimized Design**:
  - Fits perfectly in launcher's 550x260 scroll window
  - Compact card layout with minimal spacing
  - Hover effects for better interactivity
  - Clean, uncluttered information display

## Data Storage

Usage data is stored in `config/json/screentime/` directory:
- `usage_YYYY-MM-DD.json` - Daily usage data files
- Data includes application class names and total seconds used
- Automatic cleanup of old data (configurable retention period)
- Weekly aggregation for trend analysis

## How It Works

1. **Window Tracking**: Uses `hyprctl -j activewindow` to detect the currently focused application
2. **Time Recording**: Tracks time spent in each application by monitoring window focus changes
3. **Data Persistence**: Saves usage data every 30 seconds and on plugin cleanup
4. **Visualization**: Creates custom GTK widgets with progress bars to show usage statistics

## Technical Details

- **Background Monitoring**: Runs a background thread that checks active window every 2 seconds
- **Application Detection**: Uses window class names from Hyprland for application identification
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores essential data and cleans up old cache entries
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles window manager errors and missing data

## Customization

The plugin can be customized by modifying:
- Update frequency (currently 2 seconds)
- Number of top applications shown (currently 10)
- Minimum usage time threshold (currently 1 minute)
- Bar graph colors and styling in `styles/launcher.css`

## CSS Classes

The plugin uses these CSS classes for modern GNOME-style styling:
- `#screentime-widget` - Main widget container with rounded corners
- `.screentime-title` - Main title styling
- `.screentime-time-display` - Large time display with custom font
- `.screentime-card` - Summary cards with hover effects
- `.screentime-app-item` - Individual app items with modern styling
- `.screentime-app-icon` - App icon placeholders with gradients
- `.screentime-progress` - Modern progress bars with gradients
- `.screentime-progress.high-usage` - High usage bars (red gradient)
- `.screentime-progress.medium-usage` - Medium usage bars (yellow gradient)
- `.screentime-progress.low-usage` - Low usage bars (green gradient)

## Requirements

- Hyprland window manager
- `hyprctl` command available in PATH
- GTK 3.0
- Python 3.7+

## Privacy

- All data is stored locally on your system
- No network connections or external data sharing
